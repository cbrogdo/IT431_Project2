<h2>Financial Aid</h2>

<p class="lead">Many Mason students receive some kind of financial aid, such as grants, scholarships, work-study employment, or loans.</p>

<p>To assist you with the financial aid process, Mason’s Office of Student Financial Aid has a team of dedicated professionals available to help you and your family. 
    The Financial Aid staff will work with you annually as you re-apply for financial assistance each year you attend Mason.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in applying for financial aid, complete the <a href="https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa" target="_blank"> Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</a> 
    and submit it to the federal processor by February 1, or March 1 for transfer students.  For more information, please visit
